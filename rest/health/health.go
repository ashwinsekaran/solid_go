// Package health provides the Kubernetes liveness and readiness endpoints for
// the REST service.
//
// Two checks, matching the well-known paths already used by the repo's k8s
// manifests (see k8s/d.yaml):
//
//	GET /.well-known/live   liveness  — is the process alive? Always 200 while running.
//	GET /.well-known/ready  readiness — should traffic be routed here? 200 or 503.
//
// The split matters to Kubernetes: a failing liveness probe makes the kubelet
// restart the pod, whereas a failing readiness probe only removes the pod from
// Service endpoints (no restart). On graceful shutdown we flip readiness to
// "not ready" first, so the load balancer stops sending new requests while
// in-flight ones drain — the pod stays live throughout.
//
// These endpoints are mounted outside the auth middleware in main.go, because
// the kubelet probes them without credentials.

// restart an otherwise-healthy pod.
